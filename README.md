# coinMergeProject
[Coin Merge](https://coin-merge.onrender.com/) is a video game that is meant to educate young children by providing them an opportunity to practice their coin-counting skills. Children gain these skills by merging matching coins until they create the next monetary coin, which will then replace the previous coins. This type of pattern with different coin merges educates children on math-related skills surrounding their country's coin currency.

*Coin Merge* is powered mostly by Javascript.

## Installation
The game requires internet access and localStorage acceptance. This game operates off of the web browser and requires adequate browser versions to be able to run the elements involved. The most important element for the browser version is the localStorage property for users who want to play the game in more than one sitting. Since this game is focused on progress, we use localStorage to keep track of the user's data. If the user's web browser is not compatible to use localStorage, the user's progress will be immediately erased if they leave the page or refresh it. If the user is playing our game as an educational requirement for their class, make sure that the browser being used is updated to the minimum version listed below to guarantee the user's progress will be saved locally on that device.

According to [*W3 Schools*](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp), the lowest versions that can use the 'localStorage' property are:
- **Internet Explorer** *9-11*
- **Edge** *Any & All Versions*
- **Opera** *Any & All Versions*
- **Chrome** *Any & All Versions*
- **Safari** *Any & All Versions*
- **Firefox** *Any & All Versions*

As for installation purposes, nothing is needed from this repository as the game is run entirely online at [coin-merge.onrender.com](https://coin-merge.onrender.com/). As long as the user has an appropriate version for their browser of choice that accepts the 'localStorage' element, the game is just a click away --> [Coin Merge - Play Free Now](https://coin-merge.onrender.com/).

# coinMergeProject
[Coin Merge](https://coinmerge-web.onrender.com) is a video game that is meant to educate young children by providing them an opportunity to practice their coin-counting skills. Children gain these skills by merging matching coins until they create the next monetary coin, which will then replace the previous coins. This type of pattern with different coin merges educates children on math-related skills surrounding their country's coin currency.

*Coin Merge* is powered mostly by Javascript (JQuery).

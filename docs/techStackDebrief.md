# Debrief - Technology Stack
### Mckenna Aldach, Davin Haley, Valkyrie Maves, Dexter Peterson

	For the first week of iteration, we worked on validating our technology stack. We did a really good job at 
communicating what we were all familiar with as far as where we felt comfortable developing in. Because of 
the fact that not all of us had experience in Unity, we all agreed that we would have to use something 
to run in the web browser. From there we all agreed to consider using the DOM vs using the canvas element.
After that, we all discussed the positives and negatives and what we would do to make sure we are comfortable
with our decision to use the DOM. Additionally, we did a good job at communicating our ideas for 
how we thought the game should look and operate. Not only were we open to hearing other's ideas, but we also
adapted our ideas after hearing feedback, so we did a good job at taking feedback in a positive way. 

	While this didn't come into play during our first iteration. It might be helpful for us to decide which 
steps/chores/stories need to be done prior to a certain date. For example, if someone was responsible for creating the CSS for the website, they probably wouldn't be able to do this until the color scheme was picked out, another chore. So it might behoove our group to try and make more hard-line deadlines. In summary, if we were to as a group look at what we need to accomplish, and then tried to figure out what dates we could achieve those things, it might help us stay on the same page.

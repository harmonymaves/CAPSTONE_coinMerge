# Debrief - Iteration (Week of April 18-24)
### Mckenna Aldach, Davin Haley, Valkyrie Maves, Dexter Peterson

Our team did several things well this week.  We were able to communicate both in our weekly class meeting and throughout the week via Discord.  One of our group members, Dexter, was traveling this week, and we were able to assign him tasks he could finish early in the week, giving him the ability to better enjoy his travels.  Davin was an absolute rock star this week, being a big help to Valkyrie when she got stuck on logic for her task. McKenna was incredibly efficient and helpful with her HTML tasks.

Our team is working fairly effectively, one thing that we did this week was set one day where we were all co-working at the same time.  Valkyrie thinks that setting a one or two more "work shifts" might be advantagous.  Valkyrie struggled with her tasks this week, so perhaps during the next iteration she should take a variety of tasks, instead of solely coding tasks.

Our team did run into a major production-stopping issue but the team was quick to spot the problem. The team was also quick to get into contact with each other and was able to communicate the best approaches for solving the problem. Our team's strong communication led to the problem being resolved within a decent amount of time, re-opening the opportunity to continue the production of the project.

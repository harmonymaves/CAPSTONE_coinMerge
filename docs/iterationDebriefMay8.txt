Debrief - Iteration (Week of May 1-8th)
Mckenna Aldach, Davin Haley, Valkyrie Maves, Dexter Peterson

This week, our team was able to focus on minor bugs and polishing our game.  We feel that our strong communication
and collaboration as a team is helpful in preventing problems by each of us pulling from main after each PR to 
avoid any merge conflicts, or two people writing the same code when we could manage our time better by working on 
different items.  We are also proud that our game, Coin Merge, is playable and that we are at the point where we 
are making the game more efficient and enticing to play.  We were also able to all finish our tasks early in the 
week, allowing us time to work ahead or to better enhance those game features.

Much of our feedback this week was very detail oriented, so focusing on details is a good goal for all of us this 
week.  Continuing to check each other's pull requests will help us with those details.  We'll also want to make 
sure we are all on the same page with our final design aspects, to make certain our individual designs continue to 
fit an overall theme, and preventing the game from looking a little too "DIY."
